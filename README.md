### Usage:

1. To generate a GitHub Repo Card for one of your repositories, use the following URL:

```
https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=USERNAME&repo=REPOSITORY
```

2. Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username, REPOSITORY with the name of your repository.

    â“˜ For example, if your GitHub username is "robert-warneke" and your repository name is "github-cards", your URL would look like this:

```
https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards
```

3. To use the generated card, you just need to embed the URL as an image in your README file or any other place:

```md
![GitHub Repo Card](https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards)
```
