### Usage:

1. To generate a GitHub Repo Card for one of your repositories, use the following URL:

```
https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards
```

3. To use the generated card, you just need to embed the URL as an image in your README file or any other place:

```
![GitHub Repo Card](https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards)
```

https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=USERNAME&repo=REPOSITORY<span style="color: blue;">&theme=THEME</span>
