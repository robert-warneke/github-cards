### Usage:

1. To use the GitHub Repo Card, you just need to embed the URL as an image in your README file or any other place:

```md
![GitHub Repo Card](https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=USERNAME&repo=REPOSITORY)
```

2. Replace `USERNAME` with *your GitHub username* and `REPOSITORY` with the *name of your repository*.

    For example, if your GitHub username is "robert-warneke" and your repository name is "github-cards", your URL would look like this:

```md
![GitHub Repo Card](https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards)
```
