### Usage:

1. To generate a GitHub Repo Card for one of your repositories, use the following URL:

```
https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=USERNAME&repo=REPOSITORY&theme=THEME
```

2. Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username, REPOSITORY with the name of your repository, and THEME with the name of the theme you want to use.

> â“˜ For example, if your GitHub username is "robert-warneke", your repository name is "github-cards", and you want to use the "dark" theme, your URL would look like this:

```
https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards&theme=dark
```

3. To use the generated card, you just need to embed the URL as an image in your README file or any other place:

```
![GitHub Repo Card](https://my-github-cards.vercel.app/api/github-repo-card?user=robert-warneke&repo=github-cards&theme=dark)
```
